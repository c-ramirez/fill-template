This is a sample text, here is the first parameter &P{parameter1}, here is the second &P{parameter2} here 
is the first parameter again &P{parameter1}.

Then we have a list 
&L[list]{{
	- This text should be repeated.
	- You can pass inner fields inside this list : (&F{field1})  : (&F{field2}) 
	- Another line
}}

Here goes another list

&L[list2]{{
	- Another list.
	- You can pass inner fields inside this list, even with the same names that other fields: 
		&F{field1} || &F{field2}
	- This text should be repeated.
	- You can pass inner fields inside this list : (&F{field1})  : (&F{field2})
	- Another line
}}

End of sample
